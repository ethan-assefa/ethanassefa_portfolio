I have extensive experience in public health research, much of it focusing on health equity work. Additionally, I possess knowledge in working with Big Data, particularly analyzing large Electronic Health Record (EHR) repositories. Throughout these projects, I have honed my ability to collaborate well within teams – both in setting expectations and providing updates for project leads, as well as in managing a small team to achieve set objectives. I am experienced and have the necessary flexibility to work well in both academic and professional/business settings.

Most recently, I was awarded a Fulbright Grant to conduct public health research in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. My adaptability and cross-cultural sensitivities have grown in my time there – I am confident in my ability to thrive in new environments and engage positively with diverse cultures & communities. During this experience, I led my own research study, taught data science applications for public health to students & colleagues, developed standalone applications for automating data entry, and created dashboards for tracking data collection efforts. From my time with Fulbright, I know that I would be open to work involving international travel or staying abroad for extended periods of time.
